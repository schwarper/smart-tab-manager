## Why Smart Tab Manager?

In a typical Browse session, it's easy to accumulate dozens of open tabs. Each tab consumes system resources, leading to a slower computer and a drained battery. Smart Tab Suspender solves this by gracefully "parking" tabs you haven't used in a while. When you return to a suspended tab, it reloads instantly to its previous state.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Automatic Suspension:** Automatically suspends tabs after a user-defined period of inactivity (default is 15 minutes).
* **Manual Control:** Instantly suspend the current tab, other tabs in the window, or all tabs across all windows with a single click.
* üß† **Intelligent Whitelisting:**
    * Never suspends **pinned tabs**.
    * Never suspends tabs that are **playing audio**.
    * Never suspends tabs where you are **actively filling out a form**.
    * Create a custom **exclusion list** for sites you never want to suspend.
* üöÄ **Memory & CPU Saver:** Uses Chrome's native `tabs.discard` API, which is the most efficient way to unload tabs without losing their place.
* **Tab Groups:** Automatically organizes suspended tabs into a neat group for better management.
* **Snooze Functionality:** Temporarily disable suspension for a set period when you need all tabs active.
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Highly Customizable:**
    * Adjust the inactivity timer.
    * Set a custom prefix (like üò¥) for suspended tab titles.
    * Enable or disable notifications.
    * Configure automatic tab grouping options.
* **Visual Feedback:** A badge on the extension icon shows the current number of suspended tabs.
